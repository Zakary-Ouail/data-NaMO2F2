#(a) Illustration of two (NbO2F2)nn– layers with indicated inter-octahedral angles (χ, Ψ and Ω), layer thickness (d1) and distance between layers (d2). (b) χ, d1 and d2 from NaNbO2F2 (left (b)) and NaTaO2F2 (right (b)) as a function of temperature. Linear regressions (blue lines) are plotted in the [25–220°C] temperature range guiding the evolution of each quantity. The amplitude of significant evolutions is highlighted in blue.
