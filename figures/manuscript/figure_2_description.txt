#Experimental (blue) and fitted (dashed red) MAS NMR spectra of (a) 19F (64 kHz), (c) CT of 23Na (30 kHz) and (e) static NMR spectra of 93Nb for NaNbO2F2 and MAS NMR spectra of (b) 19F (64 kHz) and (d) CT of 23Na (30 kHz) for NaTaO2F2. On the 19F spectra and on the 23Na CT of NaTaO2F2, the individual resonances used for the fits (Tables S6-S8) are shown below. On the 19F spectra, the stars indicate spinning sidebands, the main resonances are assigned and additional resonances, one assigned to NaF and the other to unidentified impurities, are outlined and their relative intensities are indicated.
