#Perspective view of the smallest octahedron unit describing the NaNbO2F2 framework with the inter-octahedral angles (Φ, Ψ, and Ω) (a). Inter-octahedral angles from NaNbO2F2 (left (b)) and NaTaO2F2 (right (b)) as a function of temperature. Linear regressions (blue lines) are plotted in the [25–220°C] temperature range guiding the evolution of each quantity. The amplitude of significant evolutions is highlighted in blue.
