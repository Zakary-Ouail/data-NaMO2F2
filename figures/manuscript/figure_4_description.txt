#Orbital-resolved Nb 4d, Ta 5d, O 2p and F 2p DOS for (a) NaNbO2F2 and (b) NaTaO2F2. (c) Off-centered [NbO4F2]5– octahedron and (d) illustration of the added covalent bonding due to distortions induced by the SOJTE. The overlap of the Nb (Ta) 4d (5d) orbital with the symmetry-adapted 2p orbital of the surrounding oxygen atoms is shown in blue. In In [TaO4F2]5– octahedron, the positive contribution in the overlap cancels the negative one so the net overlap is zero. In [NbO4F2]5– octahedron, the Nb atom is off-center, shifted in the z-direction, the net overlap gains a non-zero value.
