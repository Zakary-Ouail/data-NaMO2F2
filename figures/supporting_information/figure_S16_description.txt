#Perspective view of Na+ polyhedron (a), in which, atoms labeled X, X’ and X’’ (X = F1 and F2) are equivalent by symmetry operations. Na+ polyhedron volume (b), bond lengths (c) and distortion index (d) of NaNbO2F2 (red dots) and NaTaO2F2 (blue dots) as a function of temperature. Linear regressions (blue lines) are plotted in the [25–220°C] temperature range guiding the variation of each quantity. The amplitudes of significant variations are given and highlighted in blue.
