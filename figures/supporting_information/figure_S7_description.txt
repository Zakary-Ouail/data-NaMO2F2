#DTA (blue) and TGA (red) curves of NaNbO2F2 (top left, second cycle following the first shown in Fig. 6) and NaTaO2F2 (top right and bottom) recorded, under argon atmosphere (flow rate of 100 mL.min-1), from RT to 300/600°C, with heating/cooling rate of 10°C.min-1. The thermal accidents observed for NaNbO2F2 are highlighted in blue and their temperature values are indicated.
